# ESG_issues_identification

Companies are required to issue ESG reports to indicate compliance with Environmental, Societal, and Governance regulations. At the same time, (financial) news are produced regarding the ESG issues that may concern companies. Such issues may have a negative effect in the financial health or status of the company. The aim of this thesis is to identify such issues or their duration and impact level (multi-task learning) they may have to a company. This task involves some intricacies like:
a) Task correlation (impact duration and length) 
b) Label correlation of same origin samples (news snippets from same articles/news referring to same companies or people)
c) Limited amount of  data
d) Domain oriented narratives with technical jargon
